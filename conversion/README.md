# Conversion Utilities

**CONVERSION SCRIPTS ARE COMING SOON**

This folder contains scripts to convert output files from popular scene graph code bases to our unified output format.

They usually must be run from inside a python environment for the related repository. An SGBench installation is not required for the conversion process.

To convert, run the following command:

    python convert.py /path/to/psg.json /path/to/original /path/to/ouptut/file --method METHOD

To get more information, run the help command:

    python convert.py --help
